## About this project

**Java integration for SAP Mobile Services** is a client library to integrate your application with the backend-facing APIs of SAP Mobile Services. As this project only started, it at the moment only provides the integration to the Notification Backend services, which allows you to send push notifications to your mobile devices. Other integrated APIs may be added to this library in the future.
